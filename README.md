- Customer Sales By Number of Years
- Total Sales

# Process
1. Data Collection and Cleaning
- Import the dataset into Excel.
- Remove duplicates, handle missing values, and ensure data consistency.
2. Data Analysis
- Use pivot tables to summarize sales data by key dimensions (e.g., regions, products, time periods).
- Calculate KPIs such as total sales.
3. Dashboard Creation
- Design a visually appealing layout with slicers for interactivity.
- Add charts and graphs to represent data insights clearly.

# Project Insights
Top-Selling Product
- I was able to identify the top selling product contributing to overall revenue which was the Tonic, followed by Bottles.
  
Regional Performance
- Discovered that each region consistently does well providing opportunities for targeted marketing. When you look at the pie chart shows sales persentage in each region are
almost the same, the gap is not high.

# Final Conclusion
The Sales Dashboard successfully consolidates critical sales data into a single, interactive platform. It empowers stakeholders to:
- Monitor performance metrics in real-time.
- Make informed decisions based on trends and insights.
- Identify areas for growth and optimization.

This project demonstrates the power of Excel as a tool for data visualization and analysis, proving its utility in business intelligence tasks. Future iterations may involve integrating data from live sources or automating updates to enhance functionality.
